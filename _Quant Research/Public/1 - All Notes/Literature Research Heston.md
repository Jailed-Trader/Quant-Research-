# 📅 2025-11-26 — Daily Note

## 🎯 1. Top 3 Priorities  
The only things that truly matter today.

1.  **Start with Hull (Tier 2):** Get the high-level concept of _what_ stochastic volatility is.
2.  **Read Heston (1993) (Tier 1):** Skim it to find the SDEs and the final $P_1, P_2$ formulas. Don't get lost in the math.
3.  **Find Lecture Notes (Tier 3):** Use these to find the _exact, detailed formulas_ for the characteristic function ($f_j$) that the Heston paper might simplify or skip.
4. **Read Gatheral (Tier 2):** After you've built your pricer, read this to understand _what your results mean_ and how the parameters you're calibrating ($\rho, \sigma_v$, etc.) shape the smile.
